            As a student, I have gained a strong foundation in programming
            (Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS), computer security, and
            practical business strategies and I am excited to apply this
            knowledge to future opportunities in the field. Throughout my
            academic career, I have demonstrated a strong work ethic and a
            commitment to excellence, earning the AP Scholar with Distinction
            Award, being selected as a 2022 Delaware Secretary of Education
            Scholar, graduating highschool as the class of 2022 Valedictorian,

            While I am currently focused on my studies, I am also actively
            seeking out opportunities to gain practical experience in the
            Software Engineering field. I am eager to explore opportunities to
            further develop my skills and expertise.

            In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family, exercising, and
            traveling. I believe that a well-rounded life is essential for
            success in both personal and professional pursuits.
