            Welcome to my website. I am a student at the University of South
            Carolina pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer
            Information Systems with a minor in Business Information Management.
            I will be graduating in May 2025.
          </p>
          <p className="hero-section-description">
            Through my studies and projects, I have built a strong foundation in
            programming including Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and
            full-stack development. I have also worked with mobile technologies
            like React Native. One of my favorite projects is **Cockys Way**, a
            mobile app I built to help students navigate campus more easily. In
            addition to my coursework, I have worked as a Teaching Assistant for
            a web applications course, guiding students through JavaScript,
            React, and backend development.
          </p>
          <p className="hero-section-description">
            I enjoy solving complex problems and building applications that are
            intuitive and efficient. Whether it is developing a new feature,
            debugging an issue, or improving user experience, I am always eager
            to learn and grow as a developer.
          </p>
          <p className="hero-section-description">
            Outside of programming, I enjoy spending time with family and
            traveling. I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle and always
            looking for new experiences.
